                    Omar Khairat (born November 11, 1948) is an Egyptian composer, pianist, conductor, and founder of the Egypt-based company "Omar Khairat Group".
                    Born in Cairo, Omar was raised in a family of musicians. His uncle, Abu Bakr Khairat, a composer and architect, established the Cairo Conservatoire.
                    He joined the Cairo Conservatoire in 1959, studied piano with Italian Maestro Vincenzo Carro and followed correspondence courses in music theory and composition with the Trinity College in England. His debut performing in film music was The Night of Arresting Fatma in 1983. According to music experts and critics, Omar Khairat's music bridges contemporary Egyptian and Western music reflecting genuine maturity.
                    Khairat understands authenistic emotions and traditional Egyptian music that helps him attract a large audience spanning the world. He has regularly performed at the Cairo Opera House and in various Egyptian and International ceremonies during the last fifteen years.
